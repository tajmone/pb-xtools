# Project Branches

If you want to clone locally all of the project branches, you are advised to clone groups of related branches into separate folders in order to avoid cluttering problems with ignored files when switching branches.

Here is a list of the groups of related branches.


## PB-XTools

The main __PB XTools__ project, where all tools will be merged in from the other developement branches.

| BRANCHES    | DESCRIPTION                     |
| :---------- | :-------------                  |
| `master`    | The main __PB XTools__ project. |

## PBHGENX

**PBHGENX** main developement branch (`pbhgenx`), a fork of [00laboratories’s PBHGEN](https://bitbucket.org/Henry00/pbhgen). It couples with `pbhgen-upstream` branch, a clone of __PBHGEN__'s upstream on Bitbucket, in order to merge-in upstream updates.

| BRANCHES          | DESCRIPTION                               |
